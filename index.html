        <p id="begin">When people hear the term Genealogy, some may not know what it means or even what it is associated with and 
        some will know what it means as well as with what it connects. I aim to make genealogy a more common term and also persuade 
        people to learn their genealogy this website because then they can recieve the benefits that come with knowing ones genealogy.</p>

        <h3 class="head">Background</h3>
        <p>So this idea of benefits from genealogical knowledge comes from an article in the New York Times talking about family relations
             and that as we make them stronger, they become more beneficial to us. The article is titled
              <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/fashion/the-family-stories-that-bind-us-this-life.html">The Stories that Bind Us</a>, by 
              author Bruce Feiler. In this article the author shares a study done by Professor Marshall Duke, at Emory
               University, in 2001 to learn what families could do in order to combat the decline of the family which was 
               found through in other studies by asking kids a list of 20 questions about their family's history. At the 
               end of his study Dr. Duke found three different types of narratives:
               <ul>
                <li>The ascending family narrative (family started out with nothing and worked their way up, improving with each generation)</li>
                <li>The descending narrative (family had everything and then loses it all)</li>
                <li>The oscillating family narrative (ups like important positions and downs like a house burning)</li>
               </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The test subjects who knew the oscillating narrative were more self-confident and more resilient against diffilcult
             circumstances and settings. They knew that their prevous family members had gone through diffilcult situations and came out just 
             fine, which gave them a source to gain strength from. The last thing I want to add in this part before we talk about how to 
            gain the benefits is the last line of the article "<em>The bottom line: if you want a happier family, create, refine 
                and retell the story of your family’s positive moments and your ability to bounce back from the difficult ones. That act 
                alone may increase the odds that your family will thrive for many generations to come."(Feiler)</em></p>

        <h3 class="head">Resources</h3>
        <p>Well there are different ways to learn ones genealogy but with this website I want to focus on a perferred way that I have seen work.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First we start with gathering information about extended family like from what countries, states, or 
                cities past ancestors come from. This information can be found in census records and from certificates 
                of birth and death, also help for this would also be a genealogical expert which can be found as well as a number of 
                websites. Another source that can be very helpful if available is if any ancestors kept a journal or diary, something 
                that they recorded life events in, because this provides a first person view from the perspective of the writer. Also any photos
                stored in some box or left somewhere in a grandparent's attic are good to use as well. Some websites contain basic life 
                information available for this type of research, two sites that can be used are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ancestry</li>
                    <li>Family Search <em>(there is a video at the bottom of this website that explains how you can use 
                        Family Search to research this information)</em></li>
                </ul>
            <li>The second step is to go to to a living relative who is older and can remember stories about their history because 
                humans love and remember stories very well. When with these relatives the goal is to get them talking about their 
                history and past in order to the hear the stories they have heard and or experienced, bring a note pad or a 
                voice recorder so that way you can focus on the conversation. The information you found can be used for questions
                 like "what can you tell me about my great grandpa ______" or you can also 
                 use <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-stories-our-lives/201611/the-do-you-know-20-questions-about-family-stories">the 20 questions</a> that 
                 Dr. Duke used in his study. Whatever you use for questions don't forget to look for the three narrative types.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The ascending family narrative</li>
                    <li>The descending narrative</li>
                    <li>The oscillating family narrative</li>
                   </ul>
            <li>The third step is to look back on the information gathered from both the first and second step and analyze it, you
                 might find patterns or any of the three narratives mentioned which is worth keeping. Write down the stories that 
                 you think are beneficial for you and the next generation within your family because once you start this search
                 for genealogy and family history, you will feel encouraged to keep going. Plus if you can get enough stories and 
                 share them with people, you can inspire other people or your other family members to look into their own family 
                 history which leads to them inspiring other people and this could possibly carry over many times. Everyone can 
                 benefit from genealogical knowledge so what is the fear of sharing the cool new things that you learned?

        <h3 class="head">Origin of website</h3>
        <p>I should explain why I created this website because I did have lots of choices for how I wanted to format this as 
            well as lots of choices for what I could use this website to talk about. But I decided that I would use this platform to
            talk about something I am passionate about, I gained this passion in highschool when an assignment forced me to chose a research
            topic that I am interested in. I chose family history because I enjoy history as well as my family and I was able to learn 
            about why one should research their own family history from a non religious-based perspective, I enjoyed the information that 
            I was able to find because it added another reason for me to learn my own family history. This enjoyment has led me, still to 
            this day, to seek out other information regarding family history as well as the topic that is researched in the New York Times article.</p>
